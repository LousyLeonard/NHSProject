<div class="blocktext-pages-heading">Welcome to Get In Somerset Careers– a gateway to your career in Health &amp; Social Care in Somerset.</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>Where did we begin</h2>
In 2014, Health Education England (HEE) was given a mandate by the Department of Health to improve the training for support staff in Health &amp; Care. They took the view that the education and development for all staff working in a support role is vitally important, and began work on plans for a strategic framework to address this need and the low levels of investment typically seen across the country. In October 2014, the NHS launched a new strategy for support worker education and development called Talent for Care. Talent for Care sets out ten strategic priorities the NHS needs to address, under the following primary themes:
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.getincornwall.com/careers/get-in/">Get In</a></strong> – strategies designed to increase awareness of NHS careers, encourage more young people to work in caring roles (for example, by increasing work experience opportunities) and improving the diversity of the workforce.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.getincornwall.com/careers/get-on/">Get On</a></strong> – programmes aimed at ensuring support staff have the right knowledge, skills and attitudes to deliver safe and effective care.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.getincornwall.com/careers/go-further/">Go Further</a></strong> – providing opportunities to develop and progress careers including into preregistration degrees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happened next?</h2>
Local organisations were asked to step up, and pledge their commitment to recruiting and developing our support workforce, giving them new skills and competencies that will equip them for the future and provide real opportunities for those who wish to progress. In 2015, RCHT received some funding to support the national strategic framework Talent for Care and began working in partnership to deliver its key strategic intentions. We began talking with various national, regional and local partners about how to change this picture, to increase investment in the support workforce and to spread good practice and innovation.

In early 2016, the Get In Project was born. This part of the national Talent for Care framework is about opening more doors to employment and training in the NHS, attracting people with the right values and ability to do an excellent job and gaining the benefits of a diverse workforce.

<h2>So what are our intentions</h2>
The Talent for Care Strategic Intentions are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Broaden the ways into training and employment in Health &amp; Care through Apprenticeships, Work Experience and Volunteering. To attract more young people and improve diversity within the workforce</li>
 	<li>Increase the chances for people to try new experiences of working in the NHS</li>
 	<li>Engage more staff to act as NHS Ambassadors who can promote NHS careers to schools, colleges and local communities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
We hope with the continued success of the project, that other healthcare providers may join us on our quest for an integrated approach towards sustainable workforce development.
