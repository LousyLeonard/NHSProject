<span class="text_sub_heading">About the scheme</span>

An exciting opportunity in our Engineering function are the Degree Apprenticeships in Software Development. With opportunities at our <a class="" title="Preston" href="http://www.baesystems.com/en/careers/careers-in-the-uk/apprenticeships/current-opportunities/preston">Preston</a>,<a class="" title="Brough" href="http://www.baesystems.com/en/careers/careers-in-the-uk/apprenticeships/current-opportunities/brough">Brough</a> and Yeovil locations, the apprenticeship provides a combination of tailored industrial placements within our Military Air and Information business, with the opportunity to study for a Foundation Degree on a part time basis at a local Higher Education establishment, and the potential to continue on an Honours Degree programme, dependent on individual performance and business needs.
Upon completion of your apprenticeship, typical roles could include the design, development, production and maintenance of both airborne and ground based software including (but not limited to) that for test equipment, training systems and simulators, spares and logistical support systems, communications command and control systems etc .

Working towards both practical and academic targets, this competency based apprenticeship takes up to 4 years to complete building on your technical ability, knowledge and transferrable skills such as communication, team work, problem solving and critical-thinking.

As an Aerospace Software Development Degree Apprentice you will become highly trained and closely mentored within the software discipline. This ensures that we deliver the right software engineers to the software discipline with exactly the right match of skills and knowledge to work within our technical working environment.

From day one you will be earning a competitive salary with increases related to performance and behaviours.
