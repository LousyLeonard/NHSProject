<div class="blocktext-career-heading">A medical secretary offers administrative and secretarial skills to support the delivery of a department or a group of staff in a health Trust.</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What sort of person would I need to be?</h2>
You would be an <strong>enthusiastic</strong> and <strong>motivated</strong> person who has excellent <strong>audio-typing</strong>, <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>organisational</strong> skills. You will have a <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>professional</strong> approach to the work and enjoy the variety of communicating with a wide range of people both internal and external to a Trust.

You will have had some <strong>secretarial NHS experience</strong> and have some knowledge of <strong>medical terminology</strong>. Good knowledge of <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> applications with excellent <strong>keyboarding</strong> skills would be necessary. You would be able to <strong>manage</strong> your <strong>own workload</strong> and work as part of the <strong>team.</strong>

<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
As a medical secretary, you would be the first point of contact for all forms of communication within the clinical team. You would ensure the effective day to day running of the clinical practice and provide diary management and workload organisation for the Consultant and their team, providing cover for colleagues as necessary. You would be dealing with general correspondence, e.g. discharge summaries, reports and other communication.

You would attend meetings and take minutes. You would be able to accurately transcribe dictation, understanding the context and re-arranging as necessary. You need to liaise with other departments such as Health Records to ensure that case notes and x-rays are available and returned in a timely manner. You will also deal with other Trusts as well as other health professionals, patients and their carers.

</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>Training provided by the organisation to support me in my role?</h2>
There will be the opportunity to study for the <a href="http://www.amspar.com/">AMSPAR</a> Medical Secretarial Diploma if you do not already hold this qualification. You will receive training on the data systems operated within the Trust as well as mandatory training around health and safety. Other training may include data protection and confidentiality.

</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>I am interested in the role – what do I do?</h2>
Medical Secretary positions are advertised on <a href="http://www.jobs.nhs.uk/">NHS Jobs</a>. For more information, look at <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/administration/medical-secretary-personal-assistant">Health Careers</a>. You may already be working in the NHS and this could be a possible progression for you. If you do not have the experience, you may consider an Apprenticeship to build up skills to move on to a permanent administrative role.

</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What next – where will the role lead to?</h2>
In a large Trust you could progress to team co-ordinator to a Clinical Administration lead. With further development, you could move on to become a Service and Operational Manager. You may move into other areas of health administration or take up a role such as becoming a Personal Assistant for a senior member of staff. Administrative roles exist across the public and private sectors and these skills could enable you to look at a variety of roles.
