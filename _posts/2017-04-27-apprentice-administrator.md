<div class="blocktext-pages-heading">As an Apprentice in Business Administration, you could be working in one of the departments of a large hospital, such as medicines or emergency, supporting their administrative needs. An Apprenticeship is an opportunity to build up your skills and experience.</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What sort of person would I need to be?</h2>
To be an Apprentice in business administration, you will be someone who is <strong>eager </strong>and <strong>enthusiastic </strong>and <strong>motivated</strong> with an aptitude to learn quickly. You are likely to be someone who has a <strong>flexible </strong>approach, possesses excellent <strong>communication </strong>skills, is <strong>reliable</strong>, <strong>well organised</strong> and able to work as part of a <strong>team </strong>or <strong>independently</strong>.   Some experience of working in an office environment and/or experience of dealing with clients either paid or unpaid can support any applications. This could be obtained either by <strong>volunteering</strong> or a <strong>work experience placement</strong>. Good <strong>word processing</strong> skills are very useful as is a common sense approach to <strong>problem solving</strong>.

<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
You could be covering reception duties such as answering and processing telephone calls, dealing with general queries, booking appointments and meeting and greeting visitors – patients, staff and carers – to the department. You would be word processing clinical and routine correspondence to health professionals, patients and their carers. You would be building up your data entry skills and developing your knowledge of medical terminology.

Roles do vary depending on where you work.   If you work in stores or health records, you are unlikely to have contact with many patients, though you will have contact with many other health workers.

<h2>Training provided by the organisation to support me in my role?</h2>
You will undertake the Level 2 Intermediate Business Administration Apprenticeship. This includes the Level 2 Diploma in Business Administration (QCF) where you will cover units such as communication in a business environment, developing working relationships with colleagues and managing your own personal development. You will go to college for one day a week and develop your skills in your workplace where you will be assessed.

<h2>What next – where will this role lead to?</h2>
Once you have completed your Apprenticeship, you can apply for a permanent administration role in the NHS, care or in other sections of industry. You may want your administrative role to be more secretarial like a medical secretary or you may want to pursue a more clerical role. The skills developed during your Apprenticeship will give you a good grounding; get you on the first step of the ladder to a long term career.
