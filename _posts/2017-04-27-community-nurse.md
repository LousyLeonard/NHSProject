<div class="blocktext-career-heading">Community nurses work across a local area and are part of the District Nursing team. They work across GP practices and go into homes in their community, often working alone. It is an important role as the care they give can help minimise hospital admissions and support the early discharge of a patient.</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What sort of person would I need to be?</h2>
You will be the sort of person who doesn’t mind working on your own. Team work still plays an important part of your working life but you will be someone that is able to work without direct supervision. You will have excellent communication skills to enable you to support the patient and/or family members who may be stressed and be able to manage relationships well. You would be an individual who keeps abreast of nursing developments and who is keen to learn more. Flexibility and adaptability are key skills to enable you to deal professionally, but in a friendly manner with a variety of patients over the day.

You would also be able to identify any risks to yourself or the patient. Keeping your records up to date would be essential. A clean driving licence and vehicle would be necessary because of the travelling between patients – for a rural area like Cornwall, it is essential.

<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
You could be dealing with a variety of patients over the day of any age. Many will be elderly, but they could be terminally ill, have physical disabilities or have just been discharged from hospital. You will be going into their homes as a lone worker to deliver direct care. You may be offering advice and support or offering direct nursing care such as taking readings, administrating medicines or changing dressings. You will work with some patients to teach them how to care for themselves or supporting family members to enable them to care for the individual.

You will liaise with other local agencies such as Social Services, GP Practices as well as your own team to ensure that the patient receives the best care. During and at the end of the day, you will write up your records and enter them into the data system ensuring that everything is up to date. You will work with other members of the team on a flexible rota system which offers a 7 day a week service, so it is vital that your colleagues are able to pick up where you left off.

<h2>Training provided by the organisation to support me in my role?</h2>
As a qualified adult nurse with a degree in nursing and registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), you will have to continue to keep your personal development up to date. You will be supported through any mandatory training needs. Some of the role may involve mentoring students or other practitioners and there would possibly be support to gain that qualification.

There are District Nursing programmes if you want to develop to a higher level of qualification at postgraduate certificate or Masters’ level. You would discuss this at your appraisal with your line manager.
