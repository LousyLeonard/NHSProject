<h2>What sort of person do I need to be?</h2>
This role could be a progression for someone who has completed an Apprenticeship in clinical healthcare support at Level 2 or its equivalent. You will be an effective <strong>communicator</strong> – verbally and in writing. The role is looking for <strong>dynamic</strong> and <strong>motivated</strong> people. You would be <strong>adaptable</strong> and able to work in a <strong>calm</strong> and <strong>logical</strong> way while showing <strong>empathy</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong>. Of prime importance, is the ability to maintain <strong>confidentiality</strong> while being <strong>friendly</strong> and <strong>non-judgemental</strong>. You can work without direct supervision, within the boundaries of the role. The role supports clinics across the County, so you will be able to <strong>drive</strong> with <strong>access to a car</strong>.

<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
You will be supporting the medical and nursing team in the smooth running of contraception, GU and HIV clinics. Your duties would be varied but can include acting as a chaperone during male and female genital examinations; processing genital samples and microscopy slides; phlebotomy including HIV and Syphilis; general maintenance of the clinical area and ensuring that the clinics are stocked at all times. Some patients will be stressed either emotionally or physically and you need to deal with them in an empathetic way. There are a lot of evening clinics so it is likely that you will be asked to do more than one a week and Saturday work may also be involved.

<h2>Training provided by the organisation to support me in my role?</h2>
