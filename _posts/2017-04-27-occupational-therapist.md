<div class="blocktext-career-heading">Occupational Therapists work across Cornwall in hospitals, in the community, with Social Services, in special schools, for charities, private practice and in prisons, for example. An Occupational Therapist works with an individual who may have a chronic disease, a disability, mental health or learning disabilities, be elderly or who has suffered a trauma. The aim is support an individual to carry out everyday activities.</div>

<h2>What sort of person would I be?</h2>
You are a person who likes to <strong>work with people</strong>, to support them to be able to function as well as is possible. You will like <strong>thinking around a problem</strong> and try to come up with a <strong>creative solution</strong>. You will be a <strong>good listener</strong>, with strong <strong>communication</strong> skills so that you can be clearly understood. You are someone who likes to work <strong>independently</strong>, but who also values <strong>teamwork</strong> so that you can <strong>liaise</strong> with members of what can be a multidisciplinary team to ensure that an <strong>holistic approach</strong> is taken to a client’s needs.

You are someone who is <strong>self-motivated,</strong> <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>calm</strong> under pressure with a <strong>flexibility</strong> to respond to both the client and the wider team as well as to whatever happens during the day. If you are working in the community, you need a <strong>driving licence</strong>.

<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
Wherever you are working, you will have your own caseload. You will need to assess the needs of an individual and support them to lead a more independent life. In the case of the elderly, it may be that they have had replacement knees or hips and they need support while they develop their mobility; to enable them to live independently, they may need aids in the shower or a lift; people with dementia may need strategies to help them live independently for as long as possible; and those having a stroke may need adaptations in the house to support their independence.

Your work with children with physical or learning difficulties may involve working round how they may do everyday things like playing, communicating, using aids to increase mobility. For those with mental health problems it could be developing interests and occupational skills to move forward in their treatment.

You will be familiar with moving and handling techniques and if you are in the community, you will take equipment out with you. Accurate record keeping would be part of your day as will communicating with other team members such as an Occupational Therapy assistant or Therapy Assistant, who works under your supervision.
