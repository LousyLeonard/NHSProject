<div class="blocktext-pages-heading">As an Apprentice you will develop the skills to provide efficient and confidential administration   support to the Safeguarding Adults Team in the health sector. There are administrative roles across health and care – this is one such example, but the skills identified here are useful for many posts.</div>
<div class="blocktext">
<h2>What sort of person would I need to be?</h2>
You would be <strong>confident </strong>and able to <strong>communicate</strong> effectively and <strong>courteously</strong> with a wide range of internal and external people. You are someone who has <strong>attention to detail</strong>, is well <strong>organised </strong>with an ability to <strong>meet deadlines </strong>and <strong>prioritise</strong>. You are <strong>enthusiastic, motivated</strong> and keen to <strong>learn.</strong> You are able to work as part of a <strong>team</strong>. Knowledge of <strong>Microsoft office</strong> applications is useful, particularly word and excel. Part of the role will mean that you will be dealing with information that may be unpleasant at times. To deal with this, you need to be <strong>calm</strong> and <strong>efficient</strong> and develop an understanding of <strong>confidentiality</strong>.

<h2>What will I be doing?</h2>
In your role, you will be providing administrative support for learning disability/autism or mental wellbeing nurses who work under the Adult Safeguarding lead. Your duties could include supporting the team with hosting and training events; dealing with face to face and telephone enquiries; updating and maintaining data sheets, ensuring that they are secure because of the confidential nature of the information. You will also liaise with other staff and other organisations. Sometimes the work can be stressful and there can be interruptions.

<h2>Training provided by the organisation to support me in my role?</h2>
You will be doing the Intermediate Level 2 in Business Administration Apprenticeship which includes the Level 2 Diploma in Business Administration (QCF) where you will cover units such as communication in a business environment, developing working relationships with colleagues and managing your own personal development. You will go to college for one day a week and develop your skills in your workplace where you will be assessed. You may also do Functional skills and some mandatory training such as safeguarding.

<h2>What next – where will this role lead to?</h2>
Once you have completed your Apprenticeship, you can apply for a permanent administration role in the NHS, care or in other sections of industry.
